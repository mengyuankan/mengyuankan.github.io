I am a Research Associate at the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/), at the University of Pennsylvania, working with [Dr. Blanca E. Himes](https://himeslab.org/people/).

With a background in bioinformatics, genomics, and genetics, I specialize in utilizing computational methods and multiple omic approaches to understand mechanisms behind complex diseases. My ultimate goal is to translate these findings into actionable clinical insights.

My research focuses on several areas, including 1) multiomics integration to identify genetic variants, genes and pathways underlying disease mechanisms, 2) leverage of public omics datasets to prioritize genetic associations based on disease-, exposure-, and tissue-specific knowledge, and 3) development of open-source bioinformatics tools and pipelines to facilicate reproducible analysis and visualization of multiomics data.


I am a guest lecture in several master and Ph.D. courses. Specifically, I have given lectures on *Transcriptomic Data analysis* and *Functional Enrichment Analysis* ([BMIN 503: Data Science](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mbmi/course-descriptions.html) hosted by Dr. Blanca Himes), *Introduction to Biomedical Informatics* ([BMIN 501: Introduction to Biomedical Informatics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mbmi/course-descriptions.html) hosted by Dr. Fuchiang Tsui), and *Community Resources for Genetic Studies* ([EPID 575: Genetic Epidemiology](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/course/introduction-genetic-epidemiology) hosted by Drs. Adam Naj and Tiffani Johnson). I also instruct undergraduates, master and graduate students and clinicians to do research in the field of bioinformatics and genomics.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in genetics at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the mentorship of [Dr. Lin He](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/En/LinHe). During my Ph.D. years, I received training in statistical genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, under the mentorship of [Dr. Suzanne M. Leal](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD). Here is my [CV](docs/Mengyuan_CV.pdf).
