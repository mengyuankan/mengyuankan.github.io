I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/), at the University of Pennsylvania, working with [Dr. Blanca E. Himes](https://himeslab.org/people/).

Specialized in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, my research interests lie in identifying genetic and environmental factors that contribute to complex human diseases, via applying computational methods on multi-layered omics data. I leverage publicly available omics data to test novel hypotheses on disease mechanisms. I develop informatics tools and pipelines to facilitate reproducible analysis of omics data.

I teach transcriptomic data analysis and functional enrichment analysis at the course [BMIN 503: Data Science](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mbmi/course-descriptions.html) hosted by Dr. Himes. I instruct master students, graduate rotation students, and clinicians who are interested in omics data analysis to do research.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in genetics at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the mentorship of [Dr. Lin He](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/faculty/academicians/he-lin/). During my Ph.D. years, I received training in statistical genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, under the mentorship of [Dr. Suzanne M. Leal](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD). Here is my [CV](docs/CV_MengyuanKan.pdf).
