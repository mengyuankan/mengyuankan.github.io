Specialized in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, my research interests lie in identifying genetic and environmental factors that contribute to complex human diseases, via applying computational methods on multi-layered omics data. I leverage publicly available omics data to test novel hypotheses on disease mechanisms. I develop informatics tools and pipelines to facilitate reproducible analysis of omics data.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in genetics and biomedical informatics in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/), at the University of Pennsylvania, working with [Dr. Blanca E. Himes](https://himeslab.org/people/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in genetics at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the mentorship of [Dr. Lin He](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/faculty/academicians/he-lin/). During my Ph.D. year, I obtained training in statistical genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, under the mentorship of [Dr. Suzanne M. Leal](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD). Here is my CV.
