<p>Specilized in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, my research interests lie in identifying genetic and enviromental factors that contribute to complex human diseases, via applying computational methods on multi-layered omics data.</p>

<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in genetics and biomedical informatics in the <a href="https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/">Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics</a>, at the University of Pennsylvania, working with <a href="https://himeslab.org/people/">Dr. Blanca Himes</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in genetics at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the mentorship of <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/faculty/academicians/he-lin/">Dr. Lin He</a> and was a visiting Ph.D. student in statistical genetics at Baylor College of Medicine, under the mentorship of <a href="http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD">Dr. Suzanne M. Leal</a>. Here is my CV.</p>
